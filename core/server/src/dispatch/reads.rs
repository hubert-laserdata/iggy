//! Non-replicated read router and its per-code arms.
//!
//! Every `Operation::NonReplicated` request lands in
//! [`handle_non_replicated_request`] after the funnel's pre-auth gate; the
//! poll and consumer-offset arms live in `partition` (they read through the
//! shard mesh), everything else is served here from local shard state. The
//! catch-all arm delegates to the shared `responses` builder, which is
//! byte-shared with the HTTP read path -- authorization happens HERE (and in
//! the HTTP layer), never in the builder.
