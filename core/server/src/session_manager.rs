//! Transport-to-consensus session bridge for server.
//!
//! Maps ephemeral transport connections to durable consensus sessions.
//! Each connection goes through: `connect → login → register → bound`.
//!
//! The [`SessionManager`] is the server-side counterpart of the SDK's
//! session lifecycle. It does **not** own the `ClientTable`. That lives
//! in the consensus layer. This module tracks the binding between a
//! transport connection and the consensus-level `(client_id, session)` pair.
